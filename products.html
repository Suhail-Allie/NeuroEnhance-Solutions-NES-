        <h2>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <h2>Industry Standard Concentrations</h2>

<P>
    These are some industry standard ranges for omega-3 fatty acids in common oil sources, 
    though specific quantities may vary:
</P>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cannabis Seed Oil:</strong> Between 50 and 60 percent alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)</li>
            <li><strong>Seaweed Oil:</strong> might differ greatly depending on the species, but a typical
                 range is between 10 and 20 percent eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 20 and 30 percent 
                 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</li>
        </ul>

<P><B>Note:</B> These are rough estimates, and actual concentrations may vary depending on the specific
    source and extraction methods.</P>

    <h2>Calculating Oil Requirements</h2>

    <p>
        We can calculate the necessary dosages of each oil based on these industry requirements as well 
        as our goal ratio of 1000 mg ALA, 250 mg EPA, and 250 mg DHA for consumers seeking overall 
        health and wellness.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cannabis Seed Oil:</strong> Assuming a 50% concentration, we would require about 2 
            grams of cannabis seed oil to produce 1000 mg of ALA.</li>
        <li><strong>Seaweed Oil:</strong> Assuming a 15% concentration for EPA and a 25% concentration for 
            DHA, we would require roughly 8.33 grams of seaweed oil to obtain 250 
            mg of EPA and 250 mg of DHA.</li>
    </ul>

    <P><B>Note:</B>  These are rough estimates based on industry averages. The actual amount of oil 
        needed will depend on the precise ratios of the components you select.
    </P>
    
<h2><u>Product Formulations: Powder, Liquid, and Capsule</u></h2>
<h2>Understanding Product Forms</h2>

<p>
    Prior to going into particular computations, let's think about the effects of each product form:

</p>

<h2>Powder Form:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to combine with food or drinks, offering a range of flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Needs precise dosage; texture can be less appealing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Liquid Form:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to eat, with the option for many flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>Stability problems, possibility for oxidation, requires adequate packing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capsule Form:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy, accurate dosage that prevents chemicals from oxidizing.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>Cost of producing the capsules may make it less tempting to customers who prefer other formats.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DETERMINING QUANTITIES FOR POWDER FORM</h2>

<h2><u>Assumptions:</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li> We are going to utilize a powder foundation that has minimal effect on the omega-3 level.</li>
    <li>The recommended daily allowance of 1000 mg ALA, 250 mg EPA, and 250 mg DHA is still in place.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculations:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> We calculated about 2 grams of cannabis seed oil and 8.33 grams of seaweed oil for the 
        capsule form based on earlier measurements.</li>
    <li>We would need to spray-dry or freeze-dry the oil combination in order to turn this into powder form.</li>
    <li>The drying procedure and any additional excipients will affect the final powder weight.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<ul>When storing and packing omega-3 fatty acids in powder form, special concern must be given to 
    maintaining their stability.</li>
    <li>Without the right measuring equipment, it might be challenging to ensure exact dosage.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>DETERMINING QUANTITIES FOR LIQUID FORM</h2>

<h2><u>Assumptions:</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li> The omega-3 concentrates will be dissolved using a carrier oil (such as olive or sunflower oil).</li>
    <li>The recommended daily allowance of 1000 mg ALA, 250 mg EPA, and 250 mg DHA is still in place.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculations:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> We calculated about 2 grams of cannabis seed oil and 8.33 grams of seaweed oil for
         the capsule form based on earlier measurements.</li>
    <li>To get the required concentration, a carrier oil would be mixed with these amounts.</li>
    <li>The intended dosage per serving will determine the liquid product's ultimate volume.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<ul>Antioxidants and suitable packaging are needed to keep liquid omega-3 fatty acids stable.</li>
    <li>It may be necessary to use a measuring cup or dropper to ensure precise dosing.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>
<p>We can examine each product shape in further detail while taking things like:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Flavoring and masking:</strong> To improve taste and consumer acceptance.</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Suitable containers and materials for each product form.</li>
    <li><strong>Shelf life:</strong> Testing and analysis to determine product stability.</li>
</ul>
